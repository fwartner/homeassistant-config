        for their day, for example:\n  - Making note of unusual weather for the location
        and time of year (but not mundane details like \"0% chance of precipitation\")\n
        \ - How much time remaining until their first meeting\n  - Anything that may
        be special or unique, such as celebrating a birthday"
